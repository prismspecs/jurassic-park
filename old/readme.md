## To do:
+ teleprompters

## display/render engine
The main question is what language to use. Node has the benefit of being package managed and therefore more easily containerized. Python has a more traditional logical flow. Either way it could be constructed as a remote server.

# modules

## performance loop

1. call participants to stage
    + this involves using the name/image of people from onboarding process
    + AI voice
    + perhaps AI cartoon character
2. instruct participants on where to stand and how to act
    + one round of rehearsal
3. camera moves into position
4. action!
    + teleprompter feeds line and blocking notes
    + pose tracking & face tracking/emo analysis shown in real time
    + score is mean squared difference between expected pose + emotion and actual
    + simultaneously audience is mic'ed for SFX
5. points tallied + assembled
    + scene is given an overall score and added to the database (just a folder structure I think)
    + AI voice gives short recap of this
