This software processes a video to detect and isolate people using pose tracking. It performs skeletal detection on downscaled frames to identify human keypoints, builds a rough person-shaped mask from those skeletons, then upscales the mask to match the original frame size. Each high-resolution frame is composited with its corresponding mask to remove the background, resulting in a high-res output video with a transparent background and only the detected people visible. The thickness of the skeletal mask is adjustable, allowing control over how much area around each subject is included in the final cutout. The script also provides console updates throughout processing to indicate its current status and progress.
