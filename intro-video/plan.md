This Node software has a control interface via browser which allows the user to start playing a video file. The software also uses a connected camera to do live facial recognition on the video feed. It randomly selects a face within the webcam image and features that face full screen (by cropping and zooming) during the video at certain intervals. For example, it plays a 3 minute video. At 30 seconds to 35 seconds it shows the webcam feed with the randomly selected, cropped, and zoomed faces. It then goes back to the video. At 1:25 to 1:30 it does this again. It then continues to the play the video. At 2:08 to 2:22 it does the faces a final time before returning to the video. The video never pauses, the face feed is simply overlaid on top.
