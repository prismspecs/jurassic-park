This Node software has a control interface via browser which allows the user to start playing a video file. The software also uses a connected camera to do live facial recognition on the video feed. It randomly selects a face within the webcam image and features that face full screen (by cropping and zooming) during the video at certain intervals. For example, it plays a 3 minute video. At 1 seconds to 11 seconds it shows the webcam feed with the randomly selected, cropped, and zoomed faces. It then goes back to the video. At 1:25 to 1:30 it does this again. It then continues to the play the video. At 2:08 to 2:22 it does the faces a final time before returning to the video. The video never pauses, the face feed is simply overlaid on top.

There are two pages: one which is accessible at localhost:3000/ which is the control panel. It has a "Start Video" button. The other is at localhost:3000/screen which shows the video, and at times the cropped and scaled faces on top of that.
